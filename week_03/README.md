there are a few sights that come to mind when I think of mass users and form vs functionality.
examplt I brought up in class was netflix.   Reason why this sight works in my example is the idea that the design is made for" stupid" people

in conclution,  a sigt is designed for its users.  the same as a building.
if you build it, they will come.   
just build it for the people you plan to house.
